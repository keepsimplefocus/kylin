## 2. Sync Hive Table into Kylin
Although Kylin will using SQL as query interface and leverage Hive metadata, kylin will not enable user to query all hive tables since it's a pre-build OLAP (MOLAP) system so far. To enable Table in Kylin, use "Sync" function to sync up hive table metadata to Kylin.

## 4. Write and Execute SQL on web
Kylin's web offer a simple query tool for user to run SQL to explore existing cube, verify result and explore the result set using Pivot analysis and visualization next chapter.

> **Query Limit**
> 
> 1. Only SELECT query be supported
> 
> 2. Aggregation function and GROUP BY are supported

Go to "Insight" menu.

## 5. Pivot Analysis and Visualization
There's one simple pivot and visualization analysis tool in Kylin's web for user to explore their query result.

* General Information:

   When the query execute success, it will present a success indicator and also a cube's name which be hit. 
   Also it will present how long this query be executed in backend engine (not cover network traffic from Kylin server to browser).
